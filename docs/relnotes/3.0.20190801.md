## Highlights:

* etcd-manager-ctl is now available in the image, and for download from github
* etcd 3.3.13 is included
* etcd-manager will now run a compatible version of etcd if it is available (for example, etcd 3.3.13 instead of 3.3.11), to better import backups or support migration
* listen-metrics-urls can now be specified and will be passed through to etcd
* improved docs around internals
